// You are given an integer n. There are n rooms numbered from 0 to n - 1.

// You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). All the values of starti are unique.

// Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

// Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the lowest number.
// If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the same duration as the original meeting.
// When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original start time should be given the room.
// Return the number of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms, return the room with the lowest number.

// A half-closed interval [a, b) is the interval between a and b including a and not including b.
